## Rapier for Unity
This package lets you simulate physics in unity using Rapier. 

This is useful for when you want to run physics in non-unity clients for validation. 
E.g. Server Authoritive setup with client side prediction. An example of excellent use is running Rapier on a SpaceTimeDB server, and when syncing it with a client also running Rapier.
